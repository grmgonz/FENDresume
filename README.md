# Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 2: Interactive Resume 

## About ##
Using jQuery, I developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. I further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS.
